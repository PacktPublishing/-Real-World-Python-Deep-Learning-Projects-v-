# Real-World Python Deep Learning Projects [Video]
This is the code repository for [Real-World Python Deep Learning Projects [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/real-world-python-deep-learning-projects-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788620161), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Deep Learning allows you to solve problems where traditional Machine Learning methods might perform poorly: detecting and extracting objects from images, extracting meaning from text, and predicting outcomes based on complex dependencies, to name a few. In this course you will learn how to use Deep Learning in practice by going through real-world examples.

You will start of by creating neural networks to predict the demand for airline travel in the future. Then, you'll run through a scenario where you have to identify negative tweets for a celebrity by using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN's). Next you will create a neural network which will be able to identify smiles in your camera app. Finally, the last project will help you forecast a company's stock prices for the next day using Deep Learning. 

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of Deep Learning and the ability to build your own Deep Learning models.
