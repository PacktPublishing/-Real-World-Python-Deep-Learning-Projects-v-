"""
Prepare stock prices data for use in an LSTM network.

Our goal here is to predict a closing price of a share/stock
on a given day of a company based on the metrics from previous day.

We're working with historical stock prices data in .CSV format
for Tesla company (TSLA) from yahoo finances portal:
https://finance.yahoo.com.

Each row is a set of metrics for a given company for a given day.

We're using the exact same method that we've used in
Section 2.

The main difference is that we're using multiple
metrics/values (instead of just one in Section 2)
to predict closing price.

    Day 2 m21,m22,*m23

    if we want to train our network to predict Day1
    we don't have any data from previous day, so we can't
    do that, but for we base prediction of m23 from the
    metrics from prev data: m11,m12,m13 and we can do
    the same for day 2:

    data from Day4 to use for prediction using metrics
    from Day3.

    X:m11,m12,m13  Y:m23    since we don't have any X data from Day 0
